# Interactive Quiz

## Description 

This project is a Code Quiz written and developed using Javascript Vanilla API. The user / player of the application will be presented with a start page with accompanied by a start button. When the 'Start Quiz' button is pressed the questions will start to display on the screen and a 60 second timer will start a count down. A correct answer earns you a mark while a wrong answer deducts 10 seconds from the count down total. The quiz ends when the time is up or when all the questions have been completed. Each time a person has completed the quiz their score will be displayed with their initials on a leaderboard. 

## Task
Creating a Code Quiz with different questions and store the scores in the local storage.

Acceptance Criteria:

* GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
* WHEN I click the start button
* THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
* WHEN I answer a question
* THEN I am presented with another question
* WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
* THEN time is subtracted from the clock
* WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
* THEN the game is over
* WHEN the game is over
* THEN I can save my initials and score

Once all questions are answered the scores are displayed and stored.

## Mock-Up

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:

## Challenges

* Determing the data type to use for questions. 
* saving the users input with scores.
* Accessing saved records from the local storage.
* Returning the arrays in a sorted format.

## Things I learned 
* How useful it is to break down code using functions
* Using API's in Vanilla javascript.
* Havng different javascript files pointing to the same html.
* Making pages interactive with event listeners.
* Storing data on the client side using the local storage.
